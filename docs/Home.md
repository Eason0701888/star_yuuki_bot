This is the developer documentation for Star Yuuki BOT.

Originally, these documents will should be placed at the [Developer Center of Star Inc.](https://developer.starinc.xyz), but we confused that Star Yuuki BOT is an opensource software, which is one of the repositories on GitHub, the documents should be freedom and could be modify by its community, eventually, we upload them to GitHub Wiki.

Anyway, welcome for choosing the perfectest LINE Group Protective BOT as your helper in your life. :smiley:
