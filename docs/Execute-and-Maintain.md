## Install the dependencies

To install the modules the software required, just need to type

    pip install -Ur requirements.txt

The command will install its requirements automatically.

## Execute

It's simple that you have only a command to do

    python main.py

If the configuration have no fault, [Star Yuuki BOT](https://line.starinc.xyz/star-yuuki-bot) will boot successfully!

## Maintain

You may do some programming modification, for extending some feature by creating on your own, but `Star Yuuki BOT` while suffering a major updated, it might be making you annoyed.

Please trying to good use of [`git diff`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff) or something similar, for comparing between the new one and the one you edited, merging the best snippets to you product.

The software built-in a feature, checking the update automatically, will check `git` while booting everytime!

You may turn it off, but doing version control is necessary to a service for ensuring it stability.

Last but not least, DO NOT MAKE THE SOFTWARE AS `SELF BOT`, it is not acceptable, some features will not work, and may damage your account.
